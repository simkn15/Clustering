TODO coding:
- measureTclust.R needs cleanup
- measureBrown.R needs cleanu√•
- DEBUG hclustDivisive.R before adding the randomization.
    - Make a backup before adding the randomization.


fmeasure.R
All code that involves measuring the quality of a clustering with F-measure.

gap.R
Edited gap file, which was used to figure out how to do the gap statistics.

gapOriginal.R
Original gap file from Richard.

hclustDivisive.R
Main file for doing the Hierarchical clustering approach with Transitivity Clustering.

hclustDivisiveBackup.R
Backup file for hclustDivisive.R. Unsure when last backup was made.
30/12-17 was kast date of modification.

measureBrown.R

measureTclust.R

randomMeeting.R
Used this file in the meeting about randomization. Notes for code lines almost matches this one.

randomV2.R
Holds all the functions for randomization.
Not sure why function buildSimilarityMatrix() is in here. Something to do with importing from other files ????

utilities.R
Functions:
- clusteringWithTclust
- getProteinLabelsFromClustering
- buildSimilarityMatrix
- buildSimilarityMatrixFromBlast
- all functions used for plotting gap costs

makeSimFileFromBlast.R
Used to make the similarity file of the big data set from the given blast file.

plotsIntroduction.R
Used to make plots for the Introduction section. Not sure if this is relevant anymore.
